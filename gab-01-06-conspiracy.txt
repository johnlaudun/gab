2021-01-03T23:45:09 @DemsFearTruth: Yeah, I think Trump is going to arrest a bunch of people on the 6th... Like US Marshals roll into the House and Senate and perp walk Pelosi type thing
2021-01-04T05:14:19 @CrawfishFestival[P]: I hope so.  President Trump said, It is going to be WILD.
2021-01-04T05:40:37 @DemsFearTruth: I cannot think of anything wilder than when Pelosi pisses herself, and Schumer cries like a bitch on live CSPAN while being handcuffed
2021-01-06T05:51:40 @CrawfishFestival[P]: WILD, for sure.
2021-01-06T05:53:35 @CrawfishFestival[P]: I saw that Italian authorities ARRESTED Obama's Cybersecurity Chief in Italy, surveilled them from the moment they entered their country.
2021-01-06T05:56:01 @CrawfishFestival[P]: Obama hired him to create the algorithms for the Steal. Election results sent thru server in Frankfurt, Germany were then sent to them in Italy to be manipulated.
2021-01-06T05:58:25 @CrawfishFestival[P]: They also have records of Obama flying pallets of cash to fund THE STEAL, and Bank records of Bank accounts.
2021-01-06T05:59:07 @CrawfishFestival[P]: Flight logs, and CIA operatives involved have been identified.
2021-01-06T17:11:15 @DemsFearTruth: none of this will matter if Biden ends up in the WH
2021-01-07T09:09:58 @CrawfishFestival[P]: That's what former LEOs told me, too.
2021-01-07T09:11:29 @CrawfishFestival[P]: What about US Military - w everyone taking $ from our enemies = Communist China?
2021-01-07T13:24:39 @DemsFearTruth: It's over.  Trump surrendered last night
2021-01-07T18:17:37 @CrawfishFestival[P]: He did not say "concede", just "orderly transition".
2021-01-07T18:19:13 @DemsFearTruth: yeah, his staff is quitting left and right...   it's over.
2021-01-07T18:21:06 @CrawfishFestival[P]: What about Ukraine having international arrest warrants for their Criminal investigation w Burisma Scandal, plus....
2021-01-07T19:31:14 @DemsFearTruth: Who here is going to prosecute it?
2021-01-07T19:31:22 @DemsFearTruth: Nobody
2021-01-07T19:31:53 @DemsFearTruth: No more than he was punished for SEAL Team Six
