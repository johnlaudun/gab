# Hello there!

**UPDATE**: *if you came here looking for either the paper or the slides associated with the version of the talk I gave to UL's College of Liberal Arts, please drop me an email. (I removed the files after a week to keep the repository's size down.)*

Welcome to the working repository for my attempts to chart the normal structure of conspiracy theories. This is part of a larger project to chart traditional vernacular forms like the legend and, perhaps, like the conspiracy theory. Folklore studies has a long history of treating a variety of forms as narrative in nature, but in my own research I have found that there are varieties of traditional discourse that are not narrative in nature, but, rather, are informative, reportative, or argumentative, depending upon the performer’s own experience and expertise as well as the performance context. I have explored these topics in publications, and repositories, elsewhere, and the work here is simply part of that larger effort.

As much as possible I try both to be accessible in terms of getting at files as well as in terms of documenting what I do in fairly plain language. Having said that, I regularly fall short in both regards. If there is anything referenced here to which you do not have access or if there is anything not fully explained here, please do not hesitate to contact me. My email address is my last name followed by at louisiana dot edu. I can also be found on the fediverse: @johnlaudun@hcommons.social.
